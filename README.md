## Setup your repository

### Sign up for Project

Sign up for the project repository here: 
[https://classroom.github.com/a/1LldVyEG](https://classroom.github.com/a/1LldVyEG)

After your repository has initialized it, clone it to your computer. I recommend
putting it in your `ap-csp` directory.

After you've cloned your repository, run the `setup.sh` script in the root of
that repository to initialize it's configuration.

Upon completion it should display a message similar to this one:

```
######################################################
# SETUP IS COMPLETE. YOU SHOULD NOW CREATE A         #
# `develop` BRANCH BY RUNNING THE FOLLOWING COMMAND: #
#                                                    #
# git checkout -b develop                            #
#                                                    #
# THEN PUSH THAT BRANCH TO GITHUB BY RUNNING THE     #
# FOLLOWING COMMAND:                                 #
#                                                    #
# git push -u origin develop                         #
#                                                    #
# AFTER PUSHING, OPEN A PULL REQUEST FROM YOUR       #
# `develop`  BRANCH TO THE `main` BRANCH BY VISITING #
# THIS REPO ON GITHUB, CLICKING `Pull Requests`      #
# THEN `New pull request`. THE BASE BRANCH SHOULD BE #
# `main` and THE COMPARE BRANCH SHOULD BE `develop`. #
#                                                    #
# FINALLY, ADD YOUR INSTRUCTOR AS A REVIEWER ON      #
# GITHUB. THIS IS HOW YOUR INSTRUCTOR WILL SEE YOUR  #
# WORK.                                              #

Follow the directions to create a `develop` branch as well as pushing your
`develop` branch to Github.

Finally, create a pull request from your `develop` branch to the `main` branch
and assign `jcollard` as a reviewer.

## Milestones

### Milestone 1

Due: Thursday Feb. 25th @ 8am

For Milestone 2, you are expected to complete Lesson 6-1 through 6-6 and copy your code into the `quizzes/Lessons 7` directory for each of the associated quiz files.

### Skills of a Student

Your skills of a student covers your StudentLog repository, your in class time
management, meeting deadlines, asking for help when needed, and helping others
when able.

## Getting Help

All questions should be posted to the class Piazza board. You are also
encouraged to help other students who post on Piazza. When you post your
question, be sure to include as many details as possible for reproducing the
issue you're having.

Questions you should answer when asking a question include:

1. What are you trying to do?
2. What did you try?
3. What was the result?

Work hard to make sure the person trying to answer your question can reproduce
your error. Share your files so others can run exactly what you're running.

Also, include screenshot!

Formulating good questions is a good life long skill. You should try asking your
question on Piazza before seeking out synchronous time with Mx. Collard.
However, if you would like to meet to discuss synchronously, first, look at [Mx.
Collard's Calendar](http://tinyurl.com/mx-collard-calendar), then send them an
email with at least two proposed times you would like to meet.
